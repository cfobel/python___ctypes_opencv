ctypes-opencv - A Python wrapper for OpenCV using ctypes
========================================================

ctypes-opencv is a Python package which encapsulates the functionality of Intel's Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV). The Open Computer Vision Library is a collection of algorithms and sample code for various computer vision problems. The goal of ctypes-opencv is to provide Python access to all documented functionality of OpenCV.

Availability
============

   To get the lastest version, see:
   http://code.google.com/p/ctypes-opencv/

Requirements
============

The following packages must be installed on your platforms:
 - OpenCV 1.0 or above
 - Python 2.5 or above

ctypes-opencv detects the existence of OpenCV by detecting its shared libraries. It uses the shared libraries to provide the Python interface. ctypes-opencv uses packages 'ctypes' and 'partial', which are available in Python since version 2.5. ctypes-opencv works with Python 2.6, too.

Installation
============

Starting from version 0.3.0, ctypes-opencv is distributed via distutils. Simply type the following command to install the package:
python setup.py install

Support
-------

- Platforms: Win32, Linux, and Mac OS
- OpenCV version 1.0 and 1.1

How to use
==========

See the demo package associated with ctypes-opencv. It contains many Python demos slightly modified from those in OpenCV. You will find that, compared to their C++ and Python demo counterparts, our demos are similar in syntax, but are shorter and more elegant.
